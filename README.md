# GWC-Python
## This is our first workshop on Python Basics. We go over datatypes and variables, boolean expressions, conditional control structures, funcitons, and the Python Input function. This workshop gives you all the tools you need to create a simple calculator, which we encourage you all to create after going through the code!
